##  Overview

AppleHealthLLMBot automates Apple Health data parsing and bot interactions. It transforms XML data into CSVs via `xmldataparser.py`, ensuring seamless data analysis. The `appleHealthBot.py` categorizes user queries for workouts, sleep, or exerciseTime, storing information in an SQL database. Leveraging AI tools like ChatOpenAI, the bot retrieves and presents data, enhancing user experience and data visualization capabilities. The projects streamlined workflow and data management cater to health enthusiasts seeking efficient health data processing and analysis.
